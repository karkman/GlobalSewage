# GlobalSewage Project
This repository contains all data analysis for ***Predicting clinical resistance prevalence using sewage metagenomic data*** (DOI:XXX).

This study is based on the sewage metagenomes from ***Global monitoring of antimicrobial resistance based on metagenomics analyses of urban sewage*** by Hendriksen _et al_. 2019 (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-08853-3). These metagenomes used in this study can be downloaded from ENA under project accession number ERP015409 or from SRA under project accession PRJEB13831.

The clinical resistance and socioeconomical data sources are described in Table 1 in the article and can be found from the `Data` folder in this repository.
